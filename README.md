# PAPER_Occurrence-of-Meloidogyne-hapla-relative-to-nematode-abundance-and-SFW-structure-PCA-

Despite considerable knowledge of distribution, biology and parasitic variability (PV) of Meloidogyne hapla in cropping systems, how its PV relates to soil health conditions remains unknown. This study investigated the relationship between the presence or absence of M. hapla with soil food web and the abundance of nematode community in muck (high organic matter) and mineral soils of 15 agricultural fields and adjacent natural vegetation across three vegetable production regions of Michigan, USA. Meloidogyne hapla was present in all regions and all muck soils, but only in some mineral soils. It was present in soils with degraded and disturbed soil food web conditions, but there was no pattern with nematode trophic group abundance. However, principal component analysis showed distinct relationships among M. hapla presence or absence, soils, nematode abundance parameters in agricultural and natural vegetation. The study lays down a foundation for more targeted investigations to understand any links between the PV of M. hapla and its soil environment.
